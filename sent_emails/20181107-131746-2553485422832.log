Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address root@Naver.com. Follow the link below:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/reset/NA/513-5061b0df261263b64db9/

In case you forgot your Django Boards username: root

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying
to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Boards Team
